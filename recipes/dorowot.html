    <h2>DORO WaT</h2>
    <p>Doro wat (also spelled doro wot) is an Ethiopian chicken stew flavored with a spiced butter called niter kibbeh and berbere, 
        a spice blend that often includes fenugreek, hot chiles, paprika, cardamom, and coriander. 
        Toward the end of cooking, hard-boiled eggs are added to the stew. Doro wat is typically served with injera bread,
         a flatbread made with teff, the staple grain of Ethiopia.
         It's one of the most recognizable Ethiopian foods and is served in Ethiopian restaurants around the world.</p>
