Marqaa(also known as Genfo in Amharic and Ga’at in Tigrigna) is a thick porridge usually eaten for breakfast. 
Its typically made with barley flour, which is sometimes dry-roasted before cooking. 
It is then added to boiling water and stirred with a wooden dowel until smooth and very thick. 
Once the porridge is mounded in a bowl, a well is created at the center. The final step is to fill the well with purified butter.
 The then completed dish is served plain or flanked by scoops of yogurt. 
Marqaa is originally a traditional meal eaten in the Oromia region but since has been adopted throughout Ethiopia. 
Though, the cuisine served during breakfast time, there are exceptional occasions like the birth of a new child or
 weddings where merqaa is more prominent in the Oromo culture.
