    <p>
        Chuko, barley conserved with butter, is traditional food of Oromia region in Ethiopia. 
        It is traditionally made by women from barley powder mixed 
        with a sufficient amount of distilled butter, 
        along with ginger, onion, salt and spices. 
        Chuko is easy to prepare in a short time, and is full of protein because of 
        its high butter content.

        Chuko is both a part of the everyday diet and prepared for special events. 
        It is popular among those on long journeys or away at university because of its long shelf life. 
        It is also prepared for holidays and festivals. 
        It is traditionally related with Oromo weddings, served by the bride’s parents to the groom’s best men. 
        Chuko is mainly produced for home consumption, but can also be found at local markets.
